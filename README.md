### Data Flow
1. **Collection**: Tracker Lambda queries CloudTrail every hour across all regions
2. **Storage**: Events stored in DynamoDB for real-time queries
3. **Export**: Export Lambda converts daily data to Parquet format in S3
4. **Analytics**: Glue crawlers discover partitions, Athena enables SQL queries
5. **Optimization**: S3 lifecycle rules archive old data to reduce costs

## Prerequisites

- AWS Account with appropriate permissions
- AWS CLI installed and configured
- SAM CLI installed ([Installation Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/install-sam-cli.html))
- Python 3.13 runtime support in your AWS region
- AWS SDK Pandas Layer for Python 3.13 (automatically configured in template)

### Required IAM Permissions

To deploy and operate the IAM Activity Tracker, your AWS user/role needs the following permissions:

- **CloudFormation**: Full access to create, update, and delete stacks
- **Lambda**: Create, update functions and execution roles
- **DynamoDB**: Create tables, indexes, and manage data
- **S3**: Create buckets and manage objects (if analytics enabled)
- **EventBridge**: Create and manage rules
- **CloudWatch**: Create log groups and alarms
- **IAM**: Create and manage service roles and policies
- **Glue**: Create databases, tables, and crawlers (if analytics enabled)

For deployment, you can use the AWS managed policy `PowerUserAccess` or create a custom policy with these specific permissions.

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TocConsulting/iam-activity-tracker
cd iam-activity-tracker
```

### 2. Deploy the Solution

```bash
make deploy
```

![Make Help](assets/IAM-Activity-Tracker-Deploy.png)

The deployment will:
- Build the Lambda function
- Create an S3 bucket for deployment artifacts (if needed)
- Deploy the CloudFormation stack
- Set up all required resources
- **Automatically offer to initialize the system** (recommended)

**Immediate Initialization**
After deployment, the system will ask if you want to initialize immediately. This will:
1. Collect up to 90 days of historical CloudTrail events (1-5 minutes)
2. Export data to S3 in Parquet format (if analytics enabled)
3. Set up Athena tables automatically
4. Run Glue crawler to discover partitions

**Without initialization, you would need to wait 25+ hours before analytics are ready!**

### 3. View Available Commands

```bash
make help
```

![Make Help](assets/IAM-Activity-Tracker-Help.png)

This shows all available commands including deployment, queries, and utilities.

## Deployment Options

### Standard Deployment (Recommended)
```bash
export AWS_REGION=us-east-1
export AWS_PROFILE=production
make deploy
# Choose 'Y' when prompted for initialization
```

This provides the best user experience with immediate access to analytics.

### Deploy Without Initialization
```bash
make deploy
# Choose 'n' when prompted for initialization
```

Use this if you want to wait for scheduled collection (1 hour + 24 hours).

### Initialize Later
```bash
make init
```

Run this anytime after deployment to collect historical data and set up analytics.

## AWS Service Event Filtering

By default, the tracker filters out AWS service-linked role events to reduce noise and focus on security-relevant activities.

### What Gets Filtered?

Events are filtered based on CloudTrail's `userIdentity.type` field:
```json
{
  "userIdentity": {
    "type": "AWSService",
    "invokedBy": "elasticloadbalancing.amazonaws.com"
  }
}
```

### Why Filter AWS Service Events?

AWS services generate thousands of routine operational events that create noise in security monitoring:
- **Volume**: Can be 80-90% of total IAM/STS events
- **Operational**: Not indicative of user or application security activities
- **Cost**: Increases DynamoDB storage and processing costs
- **Alert fatigue**: Makes it harder to spot actual security incidents

## Role Filtering for CSPM and Security Tools

The tracker supports filtering out specific roles that generate excessive noise, particularly useful for Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) tools and security scanners.

### Common Use Cases

Filter out roles used by:
- **CSPM Tools**: PrismaCloud, Wiz, Orca, Dome9, CloudHealth
- **Security Scanners**: Qualys, Rapid7, Tenable
- **Compliance Tools**: AWS Config rules, custom compliance checkers
- **Monitoring Tools**: DataDog, New Relic, Splunk collectors

### Configuration

Set the `FilteredRoles` parameter during deployment or update:

```bash
# During deployment
sam deploy --parameter-overrides FilteredRoles="PrismaCloudRole,WizSecurityRole,*Scanner*"

# Or export before deployment
export FILTERED_ROLES="PrismaCloud*,Wiz*,OrcaSecurityRole,*CSPM*"
make deploy
```

### Filter Pattern Syntax

The filter supports multiple pattern types:

1. **Exact role names**: `SecurityAuditRole`
2. **Wildcards**: `*SecurityScanner*`, `CSPM-*`, `*-audit-role`
3. **Full ARNs**: `arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/PrismaCloudRole`
4. **Multiple patterns**: Comma-separated list

### What Gets Filtered?

When a role matches your filter patterns:
- **AssumeRole events** for that role are not stored
- **All subsequent actions** by that assumed role session are filtered
- Events are counted but not stored in DynamoDB
- Filter metrics are included in Lambda execution logs

### Example Configurations

```bash
# Filter common CSPM tools
FilteredRoles="PrismaCloud*,WizSecurityRole,OrcaSecurityRole,Dome9-Connect"

# Filter by pattern
FilteredRoles="*SecurityScanner*,*CSPM*,*Compliance*"

# Filter specific ARNs
FilteredRoles="arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/SecurityAudit,arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/CloudHealth"

# Mixed patterns
FilteredRoles="PrismaCloud*,*Scanner*,arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/SpecificRole"
```

### Monitoring Filtered Events

The Lambda response includes filtering statistics:
```json
{
  "total_events_processed": 1500,
  "total_events_filtered": 8500,  // Events filtered out
  "execution_time_seconds": 45.2
}
```

This helps you understand the impact of filtering and validate your patterns are working correctly.

- **Lambda**: $2-10/month
- **S3 storage**: $5-20/month (with lifecycle policies)
- **Athena**: $5-15/month
- **Glue**: $1-5/month (crawler executions)
- **Total**: $23-75/month

**Note**: Costs do not include SNS alerts (minimal, ~$0.10 per 1000 emails)

### Cost Optimization Features

1. **S3 Lifecycle Policies**: Automatically move data to cheaper storage classes
   - Standard (30 days) → Standard-IA (90 days) → Glacier (365 days) → Deep Archive
   - Can reduce storage costs by 80-95% for older data

2. **Parquet Format**: 70-90% smaller than JSON, reducing storage and query costs

3. **Partitioned Data**: Athena only scans relevant partitions, reducing query costs

4. **Conditional Deployment**: Disable analytics if only real-time monitoring is needed

## Querying the Data

### Real-time Queries (DynamoDB)

Perfect for recent data (last 30-90 days) and operational monitoring.

#### Using AWS Console
1. Navigate to DynamoDB in AWS Console
2. Select the events table (e.g., `iam-activity-tracker-events`)
3. Use Query or Scan with filters

#### Using AWS CLI
```bash
# Query events by user
aws dynamodb query \
  --table-name iam-activity-tracker-events \
  --index-name user_name-index \
  --key-condition-expression "user_name = :username" \
  --expression-attribute-values '{":username":{"S":"alice.johnson"}}'

# Query events by action
aws dynamodb query \
  --table-name iam-activity-tracker-events \
  --index-name event_name-index \
  --key-condition-expression "event_name = :eventname" \
  --expression-attribute-values '{":eventname":{"S":"CreateUser"}}'
```

### Analytics Queries (Athena)

Perfect for historical analysis, compliance reporting, and complex queries.

#### Quick Setup

**Option 1: Automatic (Recommended)**
The system will automatically set up Athena during deployment initialization.

**Option 2: Manual Setup**
If you skipped initialization, run this after the first export:
```bash
make setup-athena
```

**Option 3: Initialize Later**
If you deployed without initialization, you can run it anytime:
```bash
make init
```

![Setup Athena](assets/IAM-Activity-Tracker-Setup-Athena.png)

#### Pre-built Security Queries
```bash
# List all available queries
make list-queries

# Run specific security analysis (table format - default)
make run-query Q=failed_auth             # Failed authentication attempts
make run-query Q=root_usage              # Root account activity
make run-query Q=off_hours               # After-hours access
make run-query Q=active_users            # Most active users
make run-query Q=permission_changes      # IAM permission modifications
make run-query Q=role_assumptions        # Role usage patterns
make run-query Q=daily_summary           # Compliance reporting

# SSO/Identity Center queries
make run-query Q=sso_permission_sets     # SSO permission set changes
make run-query Q=sso_account_assignments # Account access grants
make run-query Q=sso_admin_policies      # Admin policy attachments
make run-query Q=sso_admin_users         # SSO administrators
make run-query Q=sso_activity_summary    # SSO usage overview

# JSON format for complete data (ALL queries support both formats!)
make run-query Q=failed_auth FORMAT=json             # Any IAM query
make run-query Q=root_usage FORMAT=json              
make run-query Q=sso_account_assignments FORMAT=json # Any SSO query
make run-query Q=sso_admin_policies FORMAT=json      
make run-query Q=active_users FORMAT=json            # Any analytics query
```

#### Output Formats

**ALL queries support two output formats:**

- **Table Format (default)**: Displays curated fields optimized to prevent truncation. Perfect for quick analysis and reporting.
- **JSON Format**: Returns complete data with all available fields. Ideal for detailed investigations or data export.

```bash
# Examples - Every query works with both formats
make run-query Q=user_lookup                  # Table format (default)
make run-query Q=user_lookup FORMAT=table     # Explicit table format
make run-query Q=user_lookup FORMAT=json      # JSON format with all fields

make run-query Q=sso_admin_policies          # Table format (default)
make run-query Q=sso_admin_policies FORMAT=json  # Complete data
```

#### Direct Athena Console Usage

For users who prefer AWS Athena console directly, all queries are available as ready-to-use SQL:

```bash
# View all queries in SQL format
cat queries/analytics_queries.sql

# Copy/paste any query directly into Athena console
# Queries use default table: iam_activity_tracker_database.iam_events
```

The `queries/analytics_queries.sql` file contains all 15 queries in standard SQL format, synchronized with the Python implementation. Perfect for:
- **Custom modifications**: Edit queries for specific requirements
- **Learning**: Understand the SQL behind each security analysis  
- **Integration**: Use with other tools beyond the CLI

-- Recent failed authentication attempts
SELECT 
    substr(event_time, 1, 10) as event_date,
    user_name,
    source_ip,
    event_name,
    error_code,
    COUNT(*) as failure_count

## Monitoring

### CloudWatch Alarms

The solution includes CloudWatch alarms for:
- **Tracker Lambda**: Errors and high execution duration (>4 minutes)
- **Export Lambda**: Errors and high execution duration (>13 minutes)

### Viewing Logs

```bash
# View tracker Lambda logs with automatic formatting
make logs

# View specific log group
make logs | grep ERROR     # Filter for errors
make logs | grep CRITICAL  # Filter for critical alerts
```

### Health Checks

```bash
# Check stack status and outputs
make status

# Test a specific query
make run-query Q=failed_auth
```

## Maintenance

### Data Retention

By default, events are kept indefinitely. To enable automatic deletion:

1. Edit `template.yaml`
2. Add TTL configuration to IAMEventsTable
3. Redeploy the stack

### Updating the Solution

```bash
# Pull latest changes
git pull

# Update deployment
make update
```

## Troubleshooting

### Data Collection Issues

1. **"Access Denied" errors**
   - Ensure Lambda has CloudTrail read permissions in all regions
   - Verify CloudTrail is enabled (check AWS Console → CloudTrail)
   - Check IAM policy attached to tracker Lambda role

2. **High tracker Lambda duration**
   - Reduce MAX_WORKERS if hitting API rate limits
   - Consider increasing schedule interval to reduce frequency
   - Check CloudWatch metrics for throttling

3. **Missing events**
   - Verify PROCESS_IAM_EVENTS and PROCESS_STS_EVENTS are true
   - Check CloudWatch Logs for region-specific errors
   - Ensure all required AWS regions are accessible

### Analytics Issues

4. **No data in S3 bucket**
   - Check export Lambda logs for errors
   - Verify ENABLE_ANALYTICS is set to true
   - Ensure DynamoDB has data before export runs
   - Check S3 bucket permissions

5. **Athena queries return no results**
   - Run Glue crawler to discover new partitions:
     ```bash
     aws glue start-crawler --name iam-activity-tracker-crawler
     ```
   - Verify S3 data location in Athena table definition
   - Check partition projection configuration

6. **High Athena costs**
   - Use LIMIT in queries during testing
   - Add date filters to reduce data scanned
   - Check query execution plans
   - Consider partition pruning

7. **Export Lambda timeout**
   - Reduce EXPORT_DAYS_BACK to process fewer days per run
   - Increase Lambda memory (currently 2048MB)
   - Check if DynamoDB has throttling issues

### Performance Optimization

8. **Slow query performance**
   - Use appropriate indexes in DynamoDB
   - Add partition filters in Athena queries
   - Consider using columnar projection in Athena

9. **Cost optimization**
   - Enable S3 lifecycle policies (automatically configured)
   - Reduce query frequency if not needed real-time
   - Use Athena workgroups to set query limits

### Debug Mode

To enable verbose logging, update the CloudFormation stack parameter:
- Set `LogLevel` parameter to `DEBUG` during deployment

### Verification Commands

```bash
# Check DynamoDB table
aws dynamodb describe-table --table-name iam-activity-tracker-events

# Check S3 bucket (if analytics enabled)
aws s3 ls s3://iam-activity-tracker-analytics-ACCOUNT_ID/iam-events/ --recursive | head -5

# Test a query
make run-query Q=daily_summary
```

## Security Considerations

- Lambda function has read-only access to CloudTrail
- DynamoDB tables are encrypted at rest
- No credentials or sensitive data in logs
- Follows principle of least privilege

## Uninstall

To remove all resources:

```bash
